Hands down, my favorite editor is notepad. The first reason I love 
notepad is because it's available on every platform by default. 
Although some platforms might use different names for it, in the end 
every platform has a default application that is primarily for .txt 
files that functions the same way. It's accessibility means I can always
open and edit files with it.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Secondly, I like that I can save the file I
edited in just about any format as long as I know the right extension. 
For example I can type code in python, java, c++, etc. using notepad and
save it as the appropriate file type (provided I save it appropriately).
Lastly, I enjoy how easy it is to manage spacing on notepad. While 
notepad does not automatically space input as you type, it follows the 
standards for tab, space, etc. as any IDE.
